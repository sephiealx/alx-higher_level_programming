Hey geeks
so i was working on my sandbox while carrying out my projects
i was in that "speed typing" zone
feeling like a super human
i was done with my project files
wrote a meanifull commit message
and was about to push the files
after typing "git push"
while the process was still loading,
i hurriedly typed the command "clear" to erase my interface
i wasnt patient enough to see the "git push process" run to the end
the "clear " command i typed interferred with the proccess
and it made my "git push" process to start lagging
It was so slow unlike the usual super speed it takes to load the process

for a long moment, i was so unsure of what next to do
my files couldnt jurney through into my GitHub
i became really worrid
i resulted into using another IDE (WSL, vagrant, VSCODE, GitBash e.t.c)
Suprisingly, they all behaved in similar ways to my sandbox

In my quest for a fast solution, i was impatient and i destroyed my sandbox
It was so funny to me, because i have never thought i would be part of those little livered persons
that results into sandbox destruct at the any sightrst provocation.

But i had to do that, to be satisfied that maybe my sandbox would be restored to its original state
no doubt i lost my local repositories and other valuable directories
Luckily, they can all be recovered and brought back into my local machine again
all thanks to open source version control tool (GitHub)
